### Exercise: Refactoring with Record Classes

#### Objective
The goal of this assignment is to help you review and improve your previous Java code by identifying and replacing classes that are primarily used to store data with `record` classes.

#### Instructions
   - Review your previous exercise solutions.
   - Select 8-10 of your previous exercises that involved creating custom classes to hold data.
   - For each eligible class, refactor the class to use `record` type.
   - Replace the class declaration with a `record` declaration, specifying the fields in the header. Remove any boilerplate code (like getters, constructors, or `toString` methods) that is now handled by the `record` automatically.
   - Make sure to update any code that interacts with these classes to ensure that it works correctly with the new `record` type.
   - Confirm that your refactoring has not changed the behavior of your code.
